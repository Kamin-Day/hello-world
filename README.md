GitHub tutorial Hello World

Well, here we go! Starting my first day of learning with the Omaha Code School!
I must say I'm very excited, as well as nervous for the things to come ahead.

My name is Kamin, and I'm interested in all sorts of activities, but sitting and playing with some code can be a great way to relax. I don't know much yet, but I'm ready to take it all in and create new ideas!
